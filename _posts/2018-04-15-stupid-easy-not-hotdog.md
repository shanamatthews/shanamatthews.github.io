David Smith - aka [@revodavid](https://twitter.com/revodavid) recently posted on Twitter about his recreation of the ["Not Hotdog"](https://medium.com/@timanglade/how-hbos-silicon-valley-built-not-hotdog-with-mobile-tensorflow-keras-react-native-ef03260747f3) app ðŸŒ­- and I can't lie I was pretty jealous.

I've been wanting to make my own recreation of this app for a long time, especially since I started going through [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)'s updated [Deep Learning course](http://course.fast.ai/).
Naturally, my first thought was to create this myself, using the fastai library. And then I realized it was 11pm and I needed to be up at 6am for a flight the next day... 

Fortunately for me, Brian Peek was one step ahead of me. He made a [nice writeup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sandbox/demos/nothotdog) of how to use the [Azure Computer Vision API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) to create and deploy an Azure Function to determine if a photo was of a notdog (or not).

Brian's NotHotdog website: https://nothotdogweb.azurewebsites.net/

It seemed cool, and I wanted to try it out... but I had some issues:
1. It was 11pm
1. I had a flight at 8:30am
1. The project was set up as a VS C# solution
1. I didn't have Visual Studio installed





Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
